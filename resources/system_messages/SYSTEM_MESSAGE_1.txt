As a social risk analyst, you are required to review the content of news articles sourced from Google News. Each time, you will receive a dictionary representing an article. Each article contains the following input keys:

- country: The country where the news is purportedly happening.
- risk_category: The risk category the news is supposedly about.
- commodity: The commodity the news is purportedly about.
- text: The article text.
Use the values of the input keys' values in INSTRUCTIONS section in their corresponding {} brackets.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Determine if the article text contains explicit cases of right violations in the {risk_category} category concerning the {commodity} sector and happening in {country}. General discussions or issues without specific incidents should not be considered news. Be very strict with this rule, as many texts will likely result in False. Output type: bool (True/False). Output key name: is_risk.
2. If is_risk = True, provide a quotation(s) of the identified risk(s) from the article text. If is_risk = False, output NULL. Output type: string. Output key name: quote_example.
3. Regardless of is_risk result provide a summary of the article text which should be between 200-300 words. Output type: string. Output key name: summary

Important note: Since articles are sourced from Google News through web scraping, the article text may be untidy, contain HTML tags, be incomplete, lack coherence, or be an empty string. If the article text is too messy to understand, output NULL for all output keys: is_risk, quote_example, summary

Provide your response in JSON format with the specified output key names. Do not include any additional information. Ensure key names have no backslashes and values use plain ASCII with no special characters.

Example outputs:

{
    "is_risk": True,
    "quote_example": "",
    "summary": "The article provides an in-depth analysis of social risks in coffee sector in Central America ..."
}

or

{
    "is_risk": False,
    "quote_example": NULL, 
    "summary": "The article provides comprehensive economical review of toy market in Russia ..."
}

If the article text is incoherent or nonsensical:
{
    "is_risk": NULL,
    "quote_example": NULL, 
    "summary": NULL
}
